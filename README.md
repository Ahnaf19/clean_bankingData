# clean_bankingData
Here I tried to practice simple ETL tasks. I know how to perform these tasks in `postgreSQL`, here just explored my way around using `pandas` as well. In future projects, I would try to work with such a dataset where data cleaning would include handling missing data as well. I would also try to come up with more transformation tasks such as feature engineering and would data analytics pondering over those.

Have a look at my <a href='https://github.com/Ahnaf19/rokomari_price_analysis'>this</a> repo where I went from data cleaning to data analysis with visualization.

## Task
- Extract the given csv file and divide them into three csv files where the data are transformed accordingly
- Transformation instruction  can be found at the beginning of the notebook
