# clean_bankingData
Here I tried to practice simple ETL tasks. I know how to perform these tasks in `postgreSQL`, here just explored my way around using `pandas` as well.

## Task
- Extract the given csv file and divide them into three csv files where the data are transformed accordingly
- Transformation instruction  can be found at the beginning of the notebook
